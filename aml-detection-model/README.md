# AML Detection Model

This project implements an AI-based Anti-Money Laundering (AML) detection model. The goal is to identify suspicious financial transactions using machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature extraction
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics including confusion matrix and ROC curve

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python aml_detection.py
   ```

3. Customize the code with your own AML datasets and parameters as needed.
